      <h1>Good morning everyone,</h1>
      <p>Today, I am going to talk about the role of Information Technology in modern education.</p>
      <p>In today’s world, IT plays a very big part in how we learn. Computers, the internet, and mobile phones have changed the way students study. We no longer need to depend only on books — now we can learn from online classes, videos, and digital libraries.</p>
      <p>Teachers also use smart boards, projectors, and online tools to make lessons more interesting and easy to understand. Students can attend classes from anywhere using apps like Google Meet or Zoom.</p>
      <p>IT also helps us to stay updated. We can search for any topic in seconds and get the latest information. It saves time and makes learning faster and fun.</p>
      <p>In short, IT has made education smarter, easier, and more creative. It connects students and teachers across the world and opens the door to endless knowledge.</p>
